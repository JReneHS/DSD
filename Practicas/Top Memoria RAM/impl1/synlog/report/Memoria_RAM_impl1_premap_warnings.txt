@W: MT531 :"d:\semestre 2-2020\dsd\practicas\top memoria ram\ram_8x8.vhd":30:3:30:4|Found signal identified as System clock which controls 9 sequential elements including cto5.O_tri_enable.  Using this clock, which has no specified timing constraint, can prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and can adversely impact design performance. 
@W: MT529 :"d:\semestre 2-2020\dsd\practicas\top memoria ram\clk_div.vhd":19:4:19:5|Found inferred clock osc00|osc_inferred_clock which controls 18 sequential elements including cto2.Qaux[2:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
