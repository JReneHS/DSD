@W: MT531 :"d:\semestre 2-2020\dsd\practicas\top teclado matricial\cont_16.vhd":16:3:16:4|Found signal identified as System clock which controls 4 sequential elements including cto8.Qaux[3].  Using this clock, which has no specified timing constraint, can prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and can adversely impact design performance.
